Each one humming with fury.\n\n\"They're trying to tell you something,\" I called to Miguel yesterday. He blessed himself and muttered about the devil's whispers.\n\nThe bees have been agitated for days. Not scared agitated. Angry agitated. Like they know something we don't. The worker bees cluster at the hive entrances, forming living curtains. They won't let me near the honey supers.\n\nVolcán de Fuego belches a gray plume against the morning sky. The rumbling starts again, a low bass note that rattles my teeth. My neighbor Carmen's goats bleated and ran yesterday. Smart animals listen to the earth.\n\nBut my bees? They spread their wings and buzz louder. Almost like they're answering the volcano back.\n\nThe truck's engine revs. Last chance to leave with the others.",

The bees have been working all night, reshaping their home.\n\nI dip my finger into an open cell. The honey tastes sharp. Metallic. Like licking a copper pipe.\n\n\"What are you trying to show me?\" I whisper.\n\nThe buzzing shifts pitch. Becomes musical. Almost like the old songs Abuela used to hum when she talked to her plants. The same songs she claimed could predict the rains.\n\nThe queen emerges from the depths. She's larger than usual, her abdomen swollen with eggs. She walks across my palm without hesitation. Her antennae brush my skin.\n\nImages flash in my mind. Underground rivers glowing red. Roots of ancient trees drinking deep. The mountain's heart beating like a drum.\n\nThe queen returns to her hive. The workers resume their spiral building.\n\nNow I understand. They're not fleeing because this isn't destruction coming.

Volcanic glass formed into perfect hexagons, each one filled with golden honey that glows with its own light.\n\nThousands of bees work here. Generations of colonies, building together in the mountain's core. They've been here longer than the village. Longer than the Spanish. Maybe longer than humans walked this slope.\n\nThe queen bee from my yard lands on a massive comb structure. She begins to dance, her movements spelling out coordinates I feel in my bones. Other queens emerge from the crystal cells. A parliament of royalty, each one ancient beyond counting.\n\nThey're not just making honey down here. They're making something else. Something that requires both fire and flowers, earth and air.\n\nThe mountain shudders. Not with destruction, but with creation. The bees have been midwifing a birth for centuries.",

They must think everyone's gone.\n\nOn the fourth morning, it begins.\n\nNot an eruption. A flowering.\n\nThe mountain splits along ancient lines, revealing chambers filled with crystallized honey. Rivers of golden magma flow downhill, cooling into amber pools. Where the molten honey touches earth, new flowers bloom. Species that have no names, in colors that hurt to look at directly.\n\nMy bees take flight. All twenty-three colonies rising together in a spiral that mirrors the volcanic steam.
